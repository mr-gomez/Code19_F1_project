# Code19_F1_project
Final project for the 2019 Coding boot camp at OSU.

# Improvements and fixes
## Drivers rankings
(04 Comparing metrics, Functions)
- When extractdiam is done, we can't detect which driver is first and last place. Maybe there is a way to fix that. It's not necessary, but it would be nice to have.
- Also, is our method optimal to sort points in ${\mathbb R}^n$? Are there other standard methods?

## Weights
(03 Lap time differences, 04 Comparing metrics, Functions)
- Is it ok to weight the $\ell_2$ metric by the number of laps?
- Is it ok to weight the races in the season by $\mu/q_i$?

- Would it be better to not weight at all?
- What other weights could we use?
