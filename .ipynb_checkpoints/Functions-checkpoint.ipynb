On the other hand, we don't want to assing too harsh a penalty in a single race because it might bias a season-wide metric. In other words, if we are not careful, one DNF will ruin a driver's complete season. For example, let's say the distance between a driver that finished the race and a driver with DNF is $\\infty$. This might make sense in a single race, but if we add the distances in two different races, it will still be $\\infty$. It doesn't matter if the DNF'd driver outperforms the competition in the following races. His distance will always be $\\infty$ (and don't even get me started with two or more DNF's).\n",

Suppose driver 3 was in 2nd place when he crashed in the second lap, after posting a time of 1:03 in the first lap. In the next laps, driver 1 stayed in 1st place and driver 2, in second. According to our methods, the lap times for driver 3 would be:\n",

    "# Driver Rankings\n",
    "Now that our metric works well on a single race, we will try to get more from it. One thing we can try is to define a drivers ranking. The idea is the following: in a single race, the two drivers that have the largest distance between them are the first and last place. Everyone else is between them. We can detect who is in second place as the driver that is closest to first place; third place is second closest, and so on. The functions below implement this idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, sort_matrix takes a square $n \\times n$ matrix $M$ and a permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and reorders the rows and columns of $M$ according to $\\sigma$. For example, if $n=3$ and $\\sigma$ is the permutation $(123)$ (ie. $\\sigma$ sends 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and 3 to 1), sort_matrix moves the first row and column of $M$ to the second row and column, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these ideas, we can sort a distance matrix according to our drivers ranking. The fastest driver will be in the first row (and column). The one closest to him will be in the second row, and so on. This is what extractdiam does. extractdiam2 does the opposite: the second to last driver is the one closest to last place, and so on (hopefully these two methods will give the same result, but I'm not 100% certain).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To be honest, when we find the drivers that have the greatest distance between them, we can't find out who is faster (distances are symmetric). At this point, we can only guess who should be first place. If we don't get it right, it shouldn't change the end result too much. At worst, the distance matrix will be sorted from slowest to fastest instead of fastest to slowest. We might fix this in the future."
